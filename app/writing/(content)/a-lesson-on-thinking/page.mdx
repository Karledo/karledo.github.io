A person who thinks all the time
Has nothing to think about except thoughts
So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions
By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull
Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words, of reckoning and calculating
I'm not saying that thinking is bad
Like everything else, it's useful in moderation
A good servant, but a bad master
And all so-called civilized peoples
Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive
Because through excessive thinking, they have lost touch with reality
That's to say
We confuse signs
With the real world

This is the beginning of meditation
Most of us would have rather money than tangible wealth
And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed
And to read about it the next day in the newspaper
Is oddly, more fun for us than the original event
This is a disaster
For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs
We are destroying nature
We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses
Time to wake up
What is reality?
Obviously, no one can say
Because it isn't words
It isn't material, that's just an idea
Reality is—

The point cannot be explained in words
I'm not trying to put you down
It's an expression of you as you are
One must live
We need to survive, to go on
We must go on
