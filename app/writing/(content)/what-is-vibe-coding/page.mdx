Andrej Karpathy, the co-founder of OpenAI and a former AI leader at Tesla, came up with the term *vibe coding* in February 2025. The concept describes a method of coding, by which programmers prompt Large Language Models (LLMs) to create functional code by using natural language.

Previously, Karpathy has described the idea of vibe coding, referring to English as "the hottest new programming language". Karpathy describes his approach as conversational, using voice commands while AI generates the actual code. "It's not really code—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy-paste stuff, and it mostly works."

AI has developed rapidly in recent years and there is continuous concern for the potential of AI to replace the job of the programmer. Integrating vibe coding into production-level code has enabled for smaller teams of engineers to build, iterate and deliver technology in a fraction of the time previously required.

Despite the rapid transition towards vibe coding, there are several limitations with the technique. One of the core principles of vibe coding lies in fully trusting LLMs and “forgetting the code even exists”, therefore, troubleshooting errors is particularly difficult in cases where LLMs are unable to fix their own errors.

Moreover, LLM's aren't perfect, issues have been raised about understanding and accountability—whilst code may work, best practices can be neglected in vital areas, including security, therefore developers may use AI-generated code without fully comprehending its functionality, making them be liable for an unknown black box of code.

Alternatively, others argue vibe coding sets a bad precedent for other professions. What would you assume of self-proclaimed vibe surgeon or a vibe anaesthetist—perhaps a vibe lawyer or a vibe firefighter?

Attaching these principles onto existing professions can be very dangerous, as people who rely on the services provided by these professions may not be comfortable with their personal information (such as credit card information, phone numbers, home address) being managed based on vibes. Or rather, patients may not want their surgeon precariously watching AI-controlled machinery perform life-saving operations from computer screens.

Although, throwing vibe coding into production-level software has its problems, there is certainly merit for the non-programmer. With the rise of vibe coding, software has become more accessible, providing people who do not speak the language of code, a way to envision ideas and watch them come to life through natural language, whether that is small programs to automate everyday tasks, or implementing a backend for a local business.

Is vibe coding a step in the right direction?

Well, that is hard to say. Change is inevitable, and sizeable changes in technology and the way that we use technology calls into question—what is the goal of human advancement?

Often, the obvious response describes humans reach a level of advancement where we aren't required to work—one where all tedious tasks aren't compulsory and the only activities remaining are recreational.But, perhaps advancement in technology, such as AI, drives us towards redundancy, taking away the things we find value in.
