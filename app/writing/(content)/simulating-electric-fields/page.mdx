    This is a simulation of electric fields demonstrating Coloumb's Law. Columb's Law links the force <Latex text="$F$" /> experienced between two charges in an electric field <Latex text="$q_1$" /> and <Latex text="$q_2$" /> , with the distance between these charges <Latex text="$r$" />. The force <Latex text="$F$" />, is proportional to <Latex text="$\frac{q_1 q_2 }{r^2}$"/> and the constant of proportionaltiy is <Latex text="$\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon _0}$" /> where <Latex text="$\epsilon _0$" /> is the vacuum permittivity, which is approximately <Latex text="$8.85 \times 10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$" />.

    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
      <Latex text="$F = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon _0 r^2 }$" />
    </div>

In this demonstration the electric field is represented by a vector field, which shows the direction of the force experienced by a single positive charge at each point in space.
