Maths is _beautiful_—Science is _elegant_.

How are mathematics and science are so intertwined? A perfect balance between prediction, proof, experimentation and observation.

One of the most fundamental fields of study is mathematics. Often times, I find that mathematical beauty comes from its intuitive way of demonstrating connections between disparate subjects—a unified language to describe the whole _universe_.

I would not say that I have a physical response—but when I find something clever and something interesting, I can not help but be inspired by intellectual curiosity in a way that most other fields do not. A mathematical connection is beautiful when I think about it—and it's related ideas and concepts, for days thereafter.

On the other hand, science represents an endless hunger for an understanding of the rules which define our existence. I love science for a multitude of reasons, but the one that stands out is the _unselfconscious humility_ inherent in its methodology.

It recognises the intrinsic fallibility of humans, which is precisely why it has an error correction machinery at its very core—a perfect blend of boundless imagination and rigourous discipline which sets it apart.
