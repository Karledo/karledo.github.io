Being overwhelmed with work can be _daunting_, and sometimes if you are truly overwhelmed to the point that you are unable to handle to workload, then perhaps it is time to take a step back and talk to the various support networks around you.

What is "Eating the frog"? _Eating the frog_ is a productivity paradigm in which you identify the most important tasks to be done, and do those first. This method is so effective, because it beats _procrastination_, which is to say, you assign your hours of greatest attentional focus to the most tedious tasks and set up the rest of the day to be a downhill sprint of easy tasks.

Another reason why this method is particularly good is because, we often underestimate the demands of a task, unless we've sat down and began to work on it. However, by structuring your most demanding tasks first, we can easily account for unexpected turns, that may shift our timeline of the task, whilst we "can be asked" to do the work.

Well, you may ask, how do we reach _flow state_? Reaching flow state can be difficult to achieve, but with right conditions— namely, intrinsic motivation, eliminated distractions and definitive objectives—it becomes possible.
