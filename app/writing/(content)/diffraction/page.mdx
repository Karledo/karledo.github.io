Here is the equation which defines the relationship between the order number for the maximum <Latex text="$n$" />, the
wavelength <Latex text="$\lambda$" />, the distance between the slits <Latex text="$d$" /> and the angle towards the
order <Latex text="$\theta$" />.

Sometimes people can overlook the fact that it's seem pretty unnatural for light to diffract when it goes through the grating. Most times in school you're taught that the slit width has to be similar to the wavelength, however, reason for this doesn't seem very apparent until you know the mechanism that causes diffraction to occur.

<AnchoredHeader id="heisenburgs-uncertainty-principle">Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle</AnchoredHeader>

The reason why diffraction occurs is because of Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle which is governed by this equation.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
  <Latex text="$\Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac{h}{4 \pi}$" />
</div>

Where <Latex text="$\Delta x$" /> is the uncertainty in the position of the particle, <Latex text="$\Delta p$" /> is the uncertainty in the momentum the particle and <Latex text="$h$" /> is Planck's constant.

This equation relates the uncertainty in the position <Latex text="$\Delta x$" /> and the uncertainty in the momentum <Latex text="$\Delta p$" />.

Take a moment to think about what this means. It means there is a minimum uncertainty to the product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum. If you are at this minimum of <Latex text="$\frac{h}{4 \pi}$" /> and you decrease the uncertainty in position further, there must be an increase in the uncertainty of momentum.

Now how does this relate to diffraction, you might ask?

Let's say that you have a very large slit width. Consider the photons going through a single slit. At the point which the photon passes through the slit, the uncertainty in the position of the particle in the plane of the diffraction grating is equal to the width of the slit.

Therefore, the uncertainty in the momentum of the particle in the plane of the momentum of the particle in the plane of the diffraction grating must be large enough to satisfy Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principle.

    Since there is some uncertainty in the component of the momentum in the plane of the diffraction grating, there is a range of directions that the photon could take after going through the diffractiong grating, leading to the diffraction pattern that we see on the screen.
